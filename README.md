# Poly FLIF
A browser poly fill for [FLIF](http://flif.info).

[Demo](https://uprootlabs.github.io/poly-flif/)

## Status

Alpha. Not tested on all browsers. Performance and size is still being optimised. 

Current JS size: 217kB (68kB minimised).

# Roadmap

* Support animations. [#2](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/2)
* Design a proper API [#6](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/6)
* Code size reduction and performance optimisation.

# What is FLIF

FLIF is a lossless image format based on MANIAC compression. MANIAC (Meta-Adaptive Near-zero Integer Arithmetic Coding) is a variant of CABAC (context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding), where the contexts are nodes of decision trees which are dynamically learned at encode time.
