# Poly FLIF
A browser poly fill for [FLIF](http://flif.info).

[Demo](https://uprootlabs.github.io/poly-flif/)

## Status

Alpha. Not tested on all browsers. Performance and size is still being optimised. 

Current JS size: 220KB (68KB minimised).
Mem layout file (will be folded into JS later): 15KB.

# Roadmap

* Design a proper API [#6](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/6)
* Code size reduction and performance optimisation.
* Animation speed and loop control. [#2](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/2)

# What is FLIF

FLIF is a lossless image format based on MANIAC compression. MANIAC (Meta-Adaptive Near-zero Integer Arithmetic Coding) is a variant of CABAC (context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding), where the contexts are nodes of decision trees which are dynamically learned at encode time.
