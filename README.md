## Roadmap

* Design a proper API [#6](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/6)
* Code size reduction and performance optimisation.
* Animation speed and loop control. [#2](https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif/issues/2)

The license of this library is GPLv3, because the upstream license is GPLv3. When [upstream moves to a more permissive license](https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF/issues/27) so will we.

## About FLIF

FLIF is a lossless image format based on MANIAC compression. MANIAC (Meta-Adaptive Near-zero Integer Arithmetic Coding) is a variant of CABAC (context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding), where the contexts are nodes of decision trees which are dynamically learned at encode time.
