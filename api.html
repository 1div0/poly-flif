<h3>Basics</h3>
The `flif.js` script performs the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Registers a handler for `DOMContentLoaded` event.</li>
<li>When the event is triggered, it scans queries all canvas elements that have `data-polyflif-src` attribute.</li>
<li>Each such &lt;canvas&gt; element will be queued for processing.</li>
<li>The URL specified in the attribute will be loaded via XHR request, decoded and rendered onto the canvas.</li>
</ol>

The canvas element will be resized to fit the image dimensions.

<h3>Controlling the image dimensions</h3>
<p>
A FLIF image can be partially decoded to yield a lower resolution image. We can utilise this to efficiently create responsive images.
</p>

<p>
First, style the canvas element using CSS so that it has the desired size. You can use media-queries to get a response size.
</p>

<p>
Then, add the `data-polyflif-scale` attribute to the canvas element. When this attribute is present, the compute size of the canvas
element is sent to the decoder (equivalent to the -r option of the FLIF CLI tool). The image is decoded so that it fits the requested
dimensions, and the canvas element is resized to the resized dimensions.
</p>

<p>
(We need to add more options here, for example, to center the image in the canvas, to upscale the image, resize the canvas to fit
actual dimensions, etc).
